# Indian_Startups_Dashboard

The "Indian Start-up Ecosystem: A Data Analysis Project" aims to provide company executives with insights into the Indian startup landscape from 2018 to 2021 to inform potential investment decisions. The project follows the CRISP-DM Framework, starting with business understanding and external research to lay a foundation, followed by data analysis to generate actionable insights. The analysis concludes with recommendations for the company. Key tools used include Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Thefuzz, and PowerBI.

To get started, the project requires Python 3.11.6, along with several libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, and Thefuzz, all of which can be installed via pip. Users need to clone the project repository from GitHub, download the startup_funding.csv dataset, and run the Jupyter notebook. The analysis is visualized through an interactive PowerBI dashboard, which helps in exploring various insights about the Indian startup ecosystem, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
